Nowadays, mostly Java 8 streams are an inseparable part of java programming. This repo is part of an Employee Management Solution in which we need to generate different statistics from Employee data like -
Employee salary department wise,
Highest paid employee in an Organisation,
Highest paid employee department wise,
Department-wise salary average etc.

I used powerful Java 8 streams to fulfill these requirements.

In fact, the use of Java 8 streams is not limited to these tasks only in my day-to-day work. As mentioned in so many other tasks like
- Finding the best possible price of a stock asset
- Finding the best bid as part of the Oracle Apps Sourcing application flow
- Loading vendor prices fast using parallel streams etc.

I used Java 8 streams.

This repo is a simple demonstration of my Java 8 skills.
